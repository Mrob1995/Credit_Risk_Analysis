Using different machine learning models attempting to predict credit risk

## Analysis

### Naive Random Oversampling

Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.646602844334948

Precision Score: 0.01

Recall Score: 0.74


### SMOTE Oversampling

Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.662394124702461

Precision Score: 0.01

Recall Score: 0.63


### Undersampling

Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.5443043836656818

Precision Score: 0.01

Recall Score: 0.67


### Combination Sampling

Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.6400726134353378

Precision Score: 0.01

Recall Score:


### Balanced Random Forest

Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.7885466545953005

Precision Score: 0.03

Recall Score: 0.70


### ADA Boost Ensemble

Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.9316600714093861

Precision Score: 0.09

Recall Score: 0.92

## Summary of Results
While we achieved considerably better results using the ADA boost method, the precision score of the model is still only 0.09. I would advise that none of these models get put forward for commercial use.
